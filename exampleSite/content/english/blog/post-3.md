> Good code is its own best documentation. - Steve McConnell

If you have ever worked with a software vendor or a freelance developer, you might be knowing how painful this stage can become. 

Here are a few things that you should ask for

### 1. Get Access

Get access to all the tools used during the development so that you can later manage it yourself or your team. Once the work is done, make sure that the unwanted users don't have access to your admin panels, online accounts, and database credentials.

### 2. Runbook to Run

Make sure that you have clear documentation to start, stop and restart your software project. A runbook should contain clear steps of action in case of any error. This will help you to resolve or mitigate the issue in lesser time.

### 3. Automated Tests

_Usually,_ software developers write tests with their code and it is good to know how to run the test suite by yourself. If you end up making changes by yourself, you can run the test suite and make sure that all features are working as expected.
